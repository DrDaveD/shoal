This directory contains preliminary work for seting up an integration
testing environment using docker containers.

This is work in progress and not yet complete nor ready for testing.




Docker installation
-------------------
For ubuntu 14.04 LTS:

  sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 36A1D7869245C8950F966E92D8576A8BA88D21E9
  sudo sh -c "echo deb https://get.docker.com/ubuntu docker main\
> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list"
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install lxc-docker

Now let's get the latest centos docker image:

  sudo docker pull centos:latest


Build and run shoal-related containers
--------------------------------------

shoal-server:

To build a new docker image with shoal server and rabbitmq server:

  cd shoal-server
  make build-image

Now you can launch a shoal server container with the following command:

  make run

To connect to the running shoal server container:

  make connect

To stop a running shoal-server container:

  make stop



squid-server:

To build a new docker image with squid server with shoal agent reporting to shoal-server above:

  cd squid-server
  make build-image

Now you can launch a squid server container with the following command:

  make run

To connect to the running squid server container:

  make connect

To stop a running squid-server container:

  make stop
